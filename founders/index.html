    <h1>Founder’s Statement</h1>
    <h2>Otis Duncan — Founder of Syfernetics</h2>

    <p>I’ve always been fascinated with how things work.</p>

    <p>As a young boy, I’d take apart my toys just to see what made them tick.  
    Sometimes I’d get them back together.  
    Sometimes… not so much.  
    But I never let that stop me.</p>

    <p>That curiosity stayed with me — even when life threw some hard hits my way.  
    I didn’t grow up with advantages.  
    I didn’t have a degree or a perfect path laid out in front of me.  
    What I had was drive, hands-on learning, and a relentless need to understand the systems around me.</p>

    <p>I found my way into the automotive world, excelling in mechanical diagnostics and repair.  
    But even while working on cars, my passion for electronics and computers never left.  
    When AI and automation started crossing into the automotive field — self-driving systems, sensor networks —  
    I realized my hobbies and my profession weren’t separate anymore. They were merging.</p>

    <p>And so was my vision.</p>

    <p>I began to see a problem that no one was addressing loud enough:  
    People have lost control over their digital lives.  
    Big Tech dictates the rules.  
    Your data isn’t yours.  
    Your systems work for someone else’s interests.</p>

    <p>That’s not acceptable.</p>

    <p>I didn’t sit back and hope someone else would fix it.  
    I knew this was a fight I had to take on myself.</p>

    <p>That’s why I founded <strong>Syfernetics</strong> —  
    To build systems that give people back what’s rightfully theirs:  
    Visibility. Control. Privacy. Defense.</p>

    <p>Syfernetics isn’t just a company.  
    It’s the product of a lifetime of persistence, curiosity, and never backing down from a challenge.</p>
